📘 Project Overview

Hackman is an intelligent Hangman word-guessing agent that uses Machine Learning techniques to predict the correct letters of a hidden word.
We implemented two models:

Hidden Markov Model (HMM) for probabilistic letter prediction

Reinforcement Learning (RL) for improving guessing accuracy through trial and reward-based learning

The goal is to train the model to “play Hangman” efficiently — minimizing wrong guesses and maximizing word-solving success rate.

⚙️ Features

Uses HMM for sequence-based prediction

Integrates Reinforcement Learning (Q-Learning / Policy-Based) to improve over time

Works on a dataset of 49,000+ English words

Achieved ~18% success rate using RL-based training

Visualizes accuracy trends during training
